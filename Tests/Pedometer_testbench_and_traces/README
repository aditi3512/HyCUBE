This tesbench is for simple pedometer code (adapt_pedometer.c) 
In the C code we specify the loop kernel by using the compiler directive in the C code, so that the compiler can understand

		#ifdef CGRA_COMPILER
           please_map_me();
        #endif

When this code is passed to LLVM based compiler, it will generate the Data Flow Graph(DFG) which is the "pedometer_dfg". It represents the dataflow. Nodes represent different operations and interconnections are the dependencies between those operations
Once DFG is generated, it is fed to the CGRA mapper to get the binary to program the configuration memories.
Testbench load the data from following two files prior to triggering the execution
	totaldata_corr.trc :: contain the instructions(which will be saved in configuration memory) and the data(which will be saved in data memory)
	totaladdr_corr.trc :: Contain the corresponding addresses in which instructions and data needs to be saved
